This is my previous project.It is a college directory management project
There are three different roles in this application. Admin,faculty,students.
I given admin details statistically in the application.Because admin is standard in college and faculty,students may change from college.
admin will register the faculty,student in this application and admin email id is 'collegeadmin@gmail.in' ,password is 'collegeadmin'.
faculty will enter student marks,other details.
Students will check there marks using their respective email and password which are entered by admin while registering the student.
Students can contact the respective subject faculty by mentioning the particular subject.
In this application I used spring boot & Mysql.
